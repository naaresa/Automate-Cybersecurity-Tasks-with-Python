    "Security analysts often analyze log files, including those that contain information about login attempts. For example as an analyst, you might flag IP addresses that relate to unusual attempts to log in to the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another area of focus in cybersecurity is detecting devices that require updates. Software updates help prevent security issues due to vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using regular expressions in Python can help automate the processes involved in both of these areas of cybersecurity. Regular expression patterns and functions can be used to efficiently extract important information from strings and files. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll write regular expressions to extract information such as device IDs or IP addresses. "
